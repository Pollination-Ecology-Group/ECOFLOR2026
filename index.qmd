**Welcome to the 23rd Annual Meeting of the Spanish Group for Floral Ecology and Evolution (ECOFLOR)!**
:::

We're pleased to announce the 23rd Annual Meeting of the Floral Ecology and Evolution working group, **EcoFlor**, which will take place from **February 11-14, 2026, in [Tortosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortosa)**.

EcoFlor is a working group of the [**Spanish Association of Terrestrial Ecology (AEET)**](https://www.aeet.org/es/english/). It organizes an annual congress to discuss recent scientific findings. The 2026 meeting will be held at the [**Centre Cívic Ferreries**](https://viurearural.cat/es/servei/centre-civic-de-ferreries-2/), located in the city center of the medieval city of Tortosa, on the banks of the Ebro River.

The EcoFlor annual meeting brings together scientists interested in floral ecology and evolution. Its goal is to promote discussion, networking, and creativity in science, involving students at all career stages in an open and friendly environment. Participants are invited to present their ongoing projects and engage in critical scientific discussion and networking. In recent years, EcoFlor has expanded its reach, achieving an international dimension and welcoming contributions from researchers worldwide.

Following the traditional format, the meeting will feature two days of presentations (Thursday and Friday, 11-12th February), including plenary talks, as well as oral and poster contributions. These will be thematically structured based on the submitted abstracts.

In addition, there will be [workshops] on [Wednesday 11th February] and a field trip on Saturday to the [Ports Natural Parks](https://www.spain.info/en/nature/els-ports-natural-park/) (a mountain range affected by a recent wildfire) and the [Delta](https://www.turismodeltadelebro.com/en/what-to-see-and-do-in-the-ebro-delta/) (an area of aquatic ecosystems and ecosystem restoration). The congress dinner will be held on [Thursday 12th February] evening.

All contributions should be in English to promote discussion and interaction with our international audience.

#### Registration and Contributions
:::

Attendance at the meeting is free, but registration is mandatory for logistical reasons. Please fill out the form if you plan to attend.

When registering, you can also submit a proposal for an oral or poster presentation. Awards will be given for the best oral and best poster presentations.

Senior researchers are also welcome to propose opening talks. These talks will be slightly longer than oral presentations and will consist of short lectures on research lines, breakthrough ideas, or emerging topics of scientific interest, rather than the results of specific studies.

We also welcome proposals for workshops to be held on Wednesday the 11th (the day of arrival). We especially encourage workshops that help early-career researchers develop skills, such as fieldwork methods, sample processing, laboratory protocols, data analysis, and scientific writing. Discussions on emerging topics of interest and networking opportunities are also welcome!

At the end of the form, there is a questionnaire to find out if you'd be interested in participating in the parallel activities. Once we know the potential attendance, we'll provide more information to participants.

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
#### Important Note
:::

The meeting is limited to 100 participants. Acceptance will be based on a combination of factors: the order of registration, whether you submit a contribution, and the scientific scope of your work. We highly encourage young researchers to submit their contributions, as the scientific commission will give them priority for acceptance.

#### Dr. Cristina Botías, "Flowers as Hotspots of Pesticide and Pathogen Exposure for Bees"

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
Cristina Botías is a Ramón y Cajal Research Fellow at the [University of Alcalá](https://www.uah.es/en/). She holds a PhD in Veterinary Science from the [Complutense University of Madrid](https://www.ucm.es/english), completed at the [Apicultural and Agri-environmental Research Center (CIAPA–IRIAF)](https://marchamalo.castillalamancha.es/), where she studied the effects of honeybee pathogens at both individual and colony levels. Her doctoral work, awarded the PhD Extraordinary Prize, provided key insights into how emerging diseases affect bee health and colony performance. Following her PhD, Cristina conducted postdoctoral research at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/) (UK), investigating pesticide exposure and its interactions with other stressors, such as pathogens. Her findings highlighted that bees are exposed to higher and more prolonged pesticide levels than previously thought. She later held a Juan de la Cierva Fellowship at the[Estación Biológica de Doñana–CSIC](https://www.ebd.csic.es/), focusing on disease pressures in wild bees, and subsequently returned to CIAPA–IRIAF with an INIA-DOC fellowship to continue her research on wild pollinator health. Since 2022, she has been based at the University of Alcalá, where her research focuses on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of pathogens affecting bumblebees and other pollinators. She also teaches undergraduate courses in Zoology and Sanitary Entomology within the degrees of Environmental Sciences, Biology, and Sanitary Biology. Cristina has published over 50 scientific articles and led several research projects funded by regional, national and international bodies. She is also active in outreach efforts, promoting awareness of pollinators' ecological importance and the threats they face.

#### Nesting traps for cavity-nesting bees and wasps in ecological studies: biology, ecology, materials and methods

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
Nesting traps simulate nesting resources for a wide diversity of bees and wasps. They are useful to standardize sampling and sample a lot of sites simultaneously. However, nesting traps can be designed in multiple ways, and their use and effectiveness is dependent on the scientific questions addressed as well as in the knowledge of the natural history of bees and wasps. In this workshop we will provide basic knowledge on the biology and ecology of cavity-nesting bees and wasps, and we will provide specific recommendations on which materials to use and how to install them to assure replicability and effectiveness of sampling.

**Instructors:** [Júlia Batlle-Benaiges], [Júlia Coromina], [Carlos Hernández-Castellano]

**Time:** [Wednesday 11th February], 10:00 - 13:00

#### Perspectives in plant-pollinator systems research in the new era of Nature Restoration

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
Plant-pollinator systems are essential to sustain biodiversity and function in ecosystems. Indeed, main research topics in the ECOFLOR community include, among others, the study of the evolution of breeding systems, pollination ecology, spatio-temporal variation in pollinator communities, and ecological networks. In a context of global change, the scientific community is adapting continuously to research and management challenges imposed by the need to reverse negative impacts and restore the integrity of ecosystems. In Europe, this framework is exemplified by the Nature Restoration Law. In this workshop, we want to organize a discussion around the framework of the Nature Restoration Law, to detect priorities, challenges, and opportunities for research in plant-pollinator systems. This will be conducted within the ECOFLOR community and will yield a multi-authored, collaborative paper, published in a scientific journal related to the research topic.

The organizers will provide preliminary information and suggestions, but the aim is that all those with interest and experience can join and lead the workshop team.

**Time:** [Wednesday 11th February], 15:00 - 18:00

### Field trip {data-link="Fieldtrip" style="text-align: justify;"}
:::

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
The field trip will take place on Saturday 14th February, visiting the [Ports Natural Parks](https://www.spain.info/en/nature/els-ports-natural-park/) (a mountain range affected by a recent wildfire) and the Delta (an area of aquatic ecosystems and ecosystem restoration). More details will be provided to registered participants.
:::

![](images/posrt.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

##### **Ports Natural Park** {style="text-align: center;"}

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
The [Ports Natural Park](https://www.catalunya.com/en/continguts/patrimoni-natural/els-ports-natural-park-17-17001-573555) is a sub-Mediterranean ecosystem predominantly mountainous and dominated by forests. It is located in the southernmost part of Catalonia (NE Spain), being part of the Iberian System mountain range and formed of calcareous mesozoic materials.

In July 2025, a wildfire originated in Paüls (a municipality close to the Ebro river) affected more than 3000 hectares of mainly *Pinus halepensis* forest.

In the first part of the visit, we will learn about 1) the ecosystems and conservation strategies present in the Ports Natural Park; 2) how the wildfire started, developed, and its consequences in the affected area; and 3) the current status of forests and fire regimes in this region. We will also discuss several topics of ecological relevance for plant-pollinator systems in areas affected by wildfires, including ongoing projects and studies.

![](images/flamingo2.png){fig-align="center" width="1600"}

##### **Delta Natural Park** {style="text-align: center;"}

:::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
The [Ebro Delta Natural Park](https://www.turismodeltadelebro.com/en/what-to-see-and-do-in-the-ebro-delta/) is one of the most important and biodiverse wetlands in the Western Mediterranean, covering around 320 km2 of rice fields, lagoons, salt marshes and sand dune systems. The Ebro Delta hosts a highly diverse community of waterbirds, including important populations of some iconic species such as the Audouin gull. During the second part of the visit, we will have lunch in the “Casa de Fusta” restaurant, where we will taste several local dishes (cost \~30€). Then we will visit the “Finca Bombita”, a former 500-ha rice farm that is being rewilded to promote biodiversity and face climate change impacts on the territory. Together with the environmental managers, we will have the opportunity to discuss: (i) the effects of climate change on sensitive environments such as the Ebro Delta, (ii) potential strategies and NbS to reduce these impacts, and (iii) the socio-environmental challenges involved in carrying out this type of restoration projects.

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
### Where to have lunch
:::

Close to the venue there are a lot of bars (e.g. Bar Ñoño) and restaurants (never a limiting factor in Spain!)

However, for those who want (no need for reservation) the Restaurant [lo Llaüt](https://share.google/IMLViGAyuDjqN4DZ9) (traditional southern catalan cuisine) will offer to us a genuine and affordable menu (based on traditional and authentic paella) on thursday and friday. Very (very) recommendable.

Another fantastic option is to have lunch in [Mercat de Tortosa](https://share.google/GI6Nx5BjW5Z5VXps4), a genuine Mediterranean market where fresh fruit, vegetables, fish and meat, mingle with quick and delicious cooking in bar stands (Market cuisine).

If you go there, you simply HAVE TO go to [Bar Ester](https://share.google/IO2bF2TtQjZKNY2v5). They are simply the best. Try the traditional “abadejo” (cod), cap-i-pota, artichoke omelette, and so on (everything local).

::: {#dinner style="text-align: center;"}
### Where to have dinner and beers
:::

Once the congress sessions end in the afternoon (\~19h) we will cross the bridge over the Ebro river, admire the Cathedral in front of us, and face two streets where plenty of bars and restaurants will help us continue networking:

-   [Avinguda de la Generalitat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/diVKPEeHXMkLHJ8s8)

-   [Carrer de Sant Blai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QqZPdsg75zNVApQK9)

Anything there and between these streets will be fine.

Remember to join the Whatsapp group [ECOFLOR Dark-Side](https://chat.whatsapp.com/KCycNVzqLEm1orgBQGjrQ2?mode=ems_copy_t) for further information (floral ecology and evolution continue at night!).

The Conference Dinner will take place on [Thursday 12th February], at a restaurant specialized in traditional and local food. Price will be \~40€ per person.

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
### What to visit
:::

if you are planning to come to Tortosa earlier or to stay a couple of days more after the congress, you may find useful this webpage: <https://www.tortosaturisme.cat/en/> Here you can find several options to enjoy the city, but also the surroundings. Tortosa is an small, ancient city in southern Catalonia, crossed by a river, and between two natural areas (mountains and sea). There is plenty of history, culture, gastronomy (and very good white wines), and an extraordinary natural environment. We will try our best to make you feel everything of these.

The 23rd edition of EcoFlor meeting is organised by **the Wildlife Pollinators Group**, a research group of the [**Wildlife Ecology and Health** **Lab**](https://weh.cat/), based in the [Veterinary Faculty of the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB).](https://www.uab.cat/web/studies/graduate/university-master-s-degrees/by-areas-of-knowledge/veterinary-medicine-1345670299644.html) Additional researchers from different institutions (IRTA, CTFC, IVIA, CREAF) are actively involved in the organisation.

In the Wildlife Pollinators Group we study the relationship between large herbivores (domestic and wild) and plant-pollinator communities and interactions,as well as in pollination function. We are also interested in understanding how other processes operating at large scales (such as wildfires) influence the assemblage of these communities. On the opposite (microscopic scale) side, we are interested in disentangling the mysteries behind solitary bee health. We conduct basic faunistic studies as well as research on bee diversity patterns in multiple types of habitats (including urban ecosystems, riparian ecosystems, and grasslands).

##### Júlia Coromina

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
MSc student in Terrestrial Ecology and Biodiversity Management at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. Since 2022, she has been studying native bees and conducting experiments in pastures with large domestic herbivores. She has also studied bee species that nest in pre-existing cavities, built entomological collections, and identified bee and other pollinators. She is currently developing her Master’s thesis on the resilience of plant–pollinator networks under different browsing levels by large wild herbivores.

##### Nil Guerrero

:::: {style="align-text: justify"}
MSc student in Terrestrial Ecology and Biodiversity Management at the [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/web/universitat-autonoma-de-barcelona-1345467954409.html). He holds a double degree in Geology and Environmental Sciences. In 2024, he began studying plant–pollinator interactions, conducting his undergraduate thesis on pollinator communities in riparian ecosystems. In addition, he has collaborated in sampling campaigns in areas affected by wildfires. He has developed strong skills in identifying bees and other pollinators both in the field and in the laboratory, as well as in preparing entomological collections. He is currently working on publications documenting new bee records in the Iberian Peninsula and preparing a review article on the role of pollinators in riparian habitats as part of his MSc.
