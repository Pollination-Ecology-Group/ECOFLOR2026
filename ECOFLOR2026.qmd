**Welcome to the 23rd Annual Meeting of the Spanish Group for Floral Ecology and Evolution (ECOFLOR)!**
:::

We're pleased to announce the 23rd Annual Meeting of the Floral Ecology and Evolution working group, **EcoFlor**, which will take place from **February 11-14, 2026, in [Tortosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortosa)**.

EcoFlor is a working group of the [**Spanish Association of Terrestrial Ecology (AEET)**](https://www.aeet.org/es/english/). It organizes an annual congress to discuss recent scientific findings. The 2026 meeting will be held at the [**Centre C√≠vic Ferreries**](https://viurearural.cat/es/servei/centre-civic-de-ferreries-2/), located in the city center of the medieval city of Tortosa, on the banks of the Ebro River.

The EcoFlor annual meeting brings together scientists interested in floral ecology and evolution. Its goal is to promote discussion, networking, and creativity in science, involving students at all career stages in an open and friendly environment. Participants are invited to present their ongoing projects and engage in critical scientific discussion and networking. In recent years, EcoFlor has expanded its reach, achieving an international dimension and welcoming contributions from researchers worldwide.

Following the traditional format, the meeting will feature two days of presentations (Thursday and Friday, 11-12th February), including plenary talks, as well as oral and poster contributions. These will be thematically structured based on the submitted abstracts.

In addition, there will be [workshops] on Wednesday 11th February and a field trip on Saturday to the [Ports Natural Parks](https://www.spain.info/en/nature/els-ports-natural-park/) (a mountain range affected by a recent wildfire) and the Delta (an area of aquatic ecosystems and ecosystem restoration). The congress dinner will be held on Thursday evening.

All contributions should be in English to promote discussion and interaction with our international audience.

#### Registration and Contributions

Attendance at the meeting is free, but registration is mandatory for logistical reasons. Please fill out the form if you plan to attend.

When registering, you can also submit a proposal for an oral or poster presentation. Awards will be given for the best oral and best poster presentations.

Senior researchers are also welcome to propose opening talks. These talks will be slightly longer than oral presentations and will consist of short lectures on research lines, breakthrough ideas, or emerging topics of scientific interest, rather than the results of specific studies.

We also welcome proposals for workshops to be held on Wednesday the 11th (the day of arrival). We especially encourage workshops that help early-career researchers develop skills, such as fieldwork methods, sample processing, laboratory protocols, data analysis, and scientific writing. Discussions on emerging topics of interest and networking opportunities are also welcome!

At the end of the form, there is a questionnaire to find out if you'd be interested in participating in the parallel activities. Once we know the potential attendance, we'll provide more information to participants.

#### Important Note

The meeting is limited to 100 participants. Acceptance will be based on a combination of factors: the order of registration, whether you submit a contribution, and the scientific scope of your work. We highly encourage young researchers to submit their contributions, as the scientific commission will give them priority for acceptance.

#### Preparing Your Abstract

Please submit your abstract in English during the registration process. The abstract should not exceed 200 words. When submitting, please also provide five keywords that will help us organize the conference sessions.

Each main author may submit only one contribution. We kindly request that the main author be the one who submits the abstract.

#### Oral Presentations

Oral presentations will be 12 minutes long, and all slides must be in English.

If your presentation is accepted, please email your slides to ecoflor2026\@gmail.com by February 2nd. The organizing committee will use your file solely for projection during the conference and will delete it immediately afterward.

#### Poster Presentations

Posters will be displayed in a room next to the main hall throughout the conference.

Poster sessions will take place during the coffee breaks: a 30-minute session in the morning and a one-hour session in the afternoon. The afternoon break, which will include coffee and beer, is specifically designed to encourage discussion and networking with poster presenters.

#### Cristina Bot√≠as

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
Cristina Bot√≠as is a Ram√≥n y Cajal Research Fellow at the University of Alcal√°. She holds a PhD in Veterinary Science from the Complutense University of Madrid, completed at the Apicultural and Agri-environmental Research Center (CIAPA‚ÄìIRIAF), where she studied the effects of honeybee pathogens at both individual and colony levels. Her doctoral work, awarded the PhD Extraordinary Prize, provided key insights into how emerging diseases affect bee health and colony performance. Following her PhD, Cristina conducted postdoctoral research at the University of Sussex (UK), investigating pesticide exposure and its interactions with other stressors, such as pathogens. Her findings highlighted that bees are exposed to higher and more prolonged pesticide levels than previously thought. She later held a Juan de la Cierva Fellowship at the Estaci√≥n Biol√≥gica de Do√±ana‚ÄìCSIC, focusing on disease pressures in wild bees, and subsequently returned to CIAPA‚ÄìIRIAF with an INIA-DOC fellowship to continue her research on wild pollinator health. Since 2022, she has been based at the University of Alcal√°, where her research focuses on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of pathogens affecting bumblebees and other pollinators. She also teaches undergraduate courses in Zoology and Sanitary Entomology within the degrees of Environmental Sciences, Biology, and Sanitary Biology. Cristina has published over 50 scientific articles and led several research projects funded by regional, national and international bodies. She is also active in outreach efforts, promoting awareness of pollinators' ecological importance and the threats they face.

#### Nesting traps for cavity-nesting bees and wasps in ecological studies: biology, ecology, materials and methods

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
Nesting traps simulate nesting resources for a wide diversity of bees and wasps. They are useful to standardize sampling and sample a lot of sites simultaneously. However, nesting traps can be designed in multiple ways, and their use and effectiveness is dependent on the scientific questions addressed as well as in the knowledge of the natural history of bees and wasps. In this workshop we will provide basic knowledge on the biology and ecology of cavity-nesting bees and wasps, and we will provide specific recommendations on which materials to use and how to install them to assure replicability and effectiveness of sampling.

**Instructors:** [J√∫lia Batlle-Benaiges], [JJ√∫lia Coromina], [Carlos Hern√°ndez-Castellano]

**Time:** [Wednesday 11th February], 10:00 - 13:00

#### Horizon scan: Emerging priorities in plant-pollinator systems research in the Mediterranean

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
Plant-pollinator systems are essential to sustain biodiversity and function in ecosystems. Indeed, they are one of the main research topics in the ECOFLOR community, and include, among others, the study of the evolution of breeding systems, pollination ecology, spatio-temporal variation in pollinator communities, and ecological networks. In a context of global change, the scientific community is adapting continuously to research and management challenges imposed by the need to reverse negative impacts and restore the integrity of ecosystems. In this workshop, we want to organize a Horizon Scan to identify research and management priorities in plant-pollinator systems research in Mediterranean ecosystems for the next decade. This will be conducted within the ECOFLOR community and will yield a multi-authored, collaborative paper, published in a scientific journal related to the research topic.

**Instructors:** [Carlos Hern√°ndez-Castellano], [Ignasi Bartomeus](https://bartomeuslab.com/)

**Time:** [Wednesday 11th February], 10:00 - 13:00

## Organisation committee

::: {style="text-align: justify;"}
The 23rd edition of EcoFlor meeting is organised by **the Wildlife Pollinators Group**, a research group of the [**Wildlife Ecology and Health** **Lab**](https://weh.cat/), based in the [Veterinary Faculty of the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB).](https://www.uab.cat/web/studies/graduate/university-master-s-degrees/by-areas-of-knowledge/veterinary-medicine-1345670299644.html) Additional researchers from different institutions (IRTA, CTFC, IVIA, CREAF) are actively involved in the organisation.

In the Wildlife Pollinators Group we study the relationship between large herbivores (domestic and wild) and plant-pollinator communities and interactions,as well as in pollination function. We are also interested in understanding how other processes operating at large scales (such as wildfires) influence the assemblage of these communities. On the opposite (microscopic scale) side, we are interested in disentangling the mysteries behind solitary bee health. We conduct basic faunistic studies as well as research on bee diversity patterns in multiple types of habitats (including urban ecosystems, riparian ecosystems, and grasslands).
